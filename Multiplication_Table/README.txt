📘 Multiplication Table Generator

🧩 Overview
This Python script generates multiplication tables from 1 to 10 and saves them in a text file called table_multi.txt.
Each table includes results from 1×1 to 10×10, neatly formatted and easy to read.

⚙️ How It Works

The program:
Opens (or creates) a file named table_multi.txt.
Iterates through numbers 1 to 10.
For each number, writes its full multiplication table.
Saves everything and closes the file.

🧠 Example Output
When you run the program, the generated file (table_multi.txt) will look like this:

La table de multiplication de  1
 1 x  1 = 1
 1 x  2 = 2
 ...
La table de multiplication de 10
10 x 10 = 100
